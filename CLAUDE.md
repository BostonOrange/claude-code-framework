# CLAUDE.md — Claude Code Framework

## Project Overview

This is the **claude-code-framework** — a reusable AI development workflow framework. It provides skills, agents, commands, rules, hooks, and templates that get installed into target projects via `setup.sh` or `setup.ps1`.

**This repo is the framework itself, NOT a target project.** Do not run setup.sh here.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Skills | Markdown (YAML frontmatter + instructions) |
| Agents | Markdown (YAML frontmatter + multi-step processes) |
| Commands | Markdown (YAML frontmatter + steps) |
| Rules | Markdown (YAML frontmatter with `patterns` + guardrails) |
| Hooks | Bash scripts |
| Setup | Bash (`setup.sh`) + PowerShell (`setup.ps1`) |
| CI/CD templates | GitHub Actions YAML |
| Config | JSON (settings.json, settings.local.json) |

## Key Conventions

### Placeholder System

Templates use `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax. `setup.sh` replaces these with project-specific values at install time.

Common placeholders:
- `{{BASE_BRANCH}}` — primary integration branch (main/develop)
- `{{PROJECT_SHORT_NAME}}` — short name for worktree directories
- `{{TEST_COMMAND}}` — project test runner (npm test, pytest, etc.)
- `{{FORMAT_COMMAND}}` — project formatter (prettier, black, etc.)
- `{{TRACKER_FETCH_TICKET}}` — API call to fetch work items
- `{{API_ROUTE_PATTERNS}}` — glob patterns for rule file scoping
- `{{SOURCE_PATTERNS}}` — glob patterns for source files (used by auth-security, data-protection, error-handling rules)
- `{{COMPONENT_PATTERNS}}` — glob patterns for UI components (used by components, design-system rules)
- `{{DATABASE_PATTERNS}}` — glob patterns for DB files
- `{{DEFAULT_MODEL}}` — default Claude model (sonnet)
- `{{DESIGN_COLOR_RULES}}`, `{{DESIGN_COMPONENT_IMPORTS}}`, `{{DESIGN_ICON_USAGE}}`, `{{DESIGN_CARD_PATTERNS}}`, `{{DESIGN_DARK_MODE}}` — design system conventions

### Adding New Skills

Copy `skills/_template/` and edit `SKILL.md`. Use YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`. See `docs/skill-authoring.md`.

### Adding New Agents

Create a `.md` file in `templates/agents/` with YAML frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`. See `docs/agents-commands-rules.md`.

### Adding New Commands

Create a `.md` file in `templates/commands/` with YAML frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`. Keep commands simple (single-purpose).

### Adding New Rules

Create a `.md` file in `templates/rules/` with YAML frontmatter: `patterns` array. Rules are guardrails, not suggestions.

### Adding New Hooks

Create a `.sh` file in `templates/hooks/`. Wire it up in `templates/settings.local.json` under the `hooks` section.

## Setup Script Architecture

Both `setup.sh` and `setup.ps1` follow the same flow:

1. **Prompt** — project type, tracker, CI/CD, base branch, notification system, project short name, design system
2. **Build placeholders** — map project type to commands (test, format, deploy, type-check, etc.)
3. **Copy files** — skills, agents, commands, rules, hooks, settings
4. **Replace placeholders** — sed (bash) or .Replace() (PowerShell) in all copied files
5. **Conditional logic** — skip `components.md` and `design-system.md` rules for backend-only projects or when no design system is configured
6. **Generate extras** — .env template, GitHub Actions workflows, CLAUDE.md

When modifying `setup.sh`, always mirror changes to `setup.ps1`.

## Agent Teams

## Testing Changes

After modifying the framework, test by running setup in a temp directory:

```bash
mkdir /tmp/test-project && cd /tmp/test-project && git init
bash ~/Developer/claude-code-framework/setup.sh
# Verify: all files copied, placeholders replaced, no {{...}} remaining
grep -r "{{" .claude/ CLAUDE.md | grep -v ".git"
```

## Version Control

- **Branch**: `main`
- Commit messages follow conventional format: `Add`, `Fix`, `Update`, `Remove`
- Co-author attribution for AI-assisted commits

## Self-Improvement (always active)

**Before ending any session where framework files were modified**, spawn `/improve` (which orchestrates `framework-improver-detector` → `framework-improver-applier`) in the background. This keeps CLAUDE.md, README.md, docs, and setup scripts in sync with the actual framework state.

Additionally, run the `framework-qa` agent to validate that all counts and tables are consistent across README, CLAUDE.md template, setup scripts, and docs.

**This is not optional.** If files changed during the session, run the improver and QA agent before wrapping up.

### How the self-improvement system works

| Layer | Mechanism | When | What |
|-------|-----------|------|------|
| **Hook** | `guardrails.sh` (PreToolUse) | Before every Bash command | Blocks dangerous ops (deploys, migrations, force push) |
| **Hook** | `post-edit-sync.sh` (PostToolUse) | After every Edit/Write | Flags which docs need updating based on what changed |
| **Agent** | `framework-improver-detector` + `framework-improver-applier` (via `/improve`) | End of every session with changes | Detector scans + builds skip-list (read-only); applier validates skip-list + applies + audit log |
| **Agent** | `framework-qa` | End of every session with changes | Validates all doc counts and tables match actual files |
| **CLAUDE.md** | This instruction | Always | Enforces the above as non-optional behavior |
