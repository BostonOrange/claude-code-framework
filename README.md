# Claude Code Framework

A reusable AI development workflow framework for Claude Code. This system reduces human touchpoints from 5+ to 2 per feature.

## What This Is

A portable set of **skills**, **agents**, **commands**, **rules**, **hooks**, **templates**, **workflows**, and **memory patterns** that give any project an advanced AI-powered development pipeline:

```
SA/PM drafts story → AI readiness gate → AI implements → AI validates → PR → CI deploys → human reviews → merge → deploy
```

## Architecture

Three separable layers:

| Layer | What | Examples | Portable? |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|
| **Workflow skills** | Development lifecycle patterns | `/develop`, `/validate`, `/factory`, `/check-readiness` | Yes — core of this framework |
| **Integration adapters** | Connect to external systems | ADO/Jira/Linear, Slack/Teams, GitHub Actions/GitLab CI | Swappable — configure per project |
| **Domain knowledge** | Project-specific references | Object inventories, API specs, business rules | Project-specific — you build these |

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the framework (once per machine)

Clone this repo anywhere you like. The path is yours to choose — the examples below use `~/claude-code-framework` (macOS/Linux) and `$HOME\claude-code-framework` (Windows).

```bash
# macOS / Linux
git clone https://github.com/<your-fork>/claude-code-framework.git ~/claude-code-framework

# Windows PowerShell
git clone https://github.com/<your-fork>/claude-code-framework.git $HOME\claude-code-framework
```

> **Do not run `setup.sh` inside the framework repo itself.** This repo is the framework; `setup.sh` installs it into a *target project*.

### 2. Run setup in your target project

```bash
# macOS / Linux
cd your-project/
bash ~/claude-code-framework/setup.sh

# Windows PowerShell
cd your-project
& $HOME\claude-code-framework\setup.ps1
```

The setup wizard asks:
- **Project type** (Salesforce, Node.js, React, Python, Go, Java, Rails, Generic)
- **Work item tracker** (Azure DevOps, Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues, None)
- **CI/CD platform** (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Jenkins, None)
- **Base branch** (main, develop, master — or custom)
- **Project short name** (used for worktree directories)
- **Notification system** (Slack, Teams, Discord, None)
- **Design system** (Material UI, Tailwind, Chakra, Ant Design, shadcn/ui, custom, or None)

Then generates:
- `.claude/skills/` — 17 workflow skills adapted to your stack (incl. `/team`, `/improve`)
- `.claude/agents/` — 12 AI agents covering full team roles (all opus)
- `.claude/commands/` — 6 quick commands (quick-test, lint-fix, check-types, branch-status, changelog, dep-check)
- `.claude/rules/` — 9 file-pattern-scoped coding guardrails (api-routes, tests, database, config, error-handling, auth-security, data-protection, design-system, components)
- `.claude/hooks/` — 6 lifecycle hooks (guardrails, post-edit-sync, session-start, session-stop, post-coding-review, pre-commit)
- `.claude/settings.local.json` — project permissions, hooks
- `.mcp.json` — MCP servers (Context7 documentation)
- `~/.claude/settings.json` — user-level AI factory permissions, team orchestration (safe-by-default)
- `CLAUDE.md` — project instructions (run `/improve` to auto-fill from project state)
- `.github/workflows/` — CI/CD templates (if GitHub Actions)

### 3. Updating the framework in an existing project

When a new version of the framework ships and you want to pull it into an existing target project:

```bash
# In the framework repo:
git pull

# In your target project:
bash ~/claude-code-framework/setup.sh
```

**What gets overwritten:** everything under `.claude/` (skills, agents, commands, rules, hooks, settings), plus `.mcp.json`. Re-running setup reapplies the installer — it replaces these files rather than merging.

**What is preserved:**
- `CLAUDE.md` at the project root — setup refuses to overwrite if it already exists
- `.env` — only created if missing
- Your code, docs, git history — setup never touches anything outside `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`, or `.github/workflows/`
- Files you added under `.claude/skills/{your-domain}/` — setup only copies framework skills, not your custom ones

**Before updating:**
1. Commit or stash any local changes (in case you customized a shipped file)
2. If you customized a file under `.claude/`, diff it against `templates/` in the framework repo first:
   ```bash
   diff .claude/hooks/post-edit-sync.sh ~/claude-code-framework/templates/hooks/post-edit-sync.sh
   ```
3. After updating, run `/improve` — it will repopulate deferred placeholders (`{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}`, `{{TECH_STACK_TABLE}}`, etc.) from current project state if they were stripped.

**To roll back:** restore the previous commit of `.claude/` — the installer is idempotent, so the previous state re-applies cleanly if you re-run the older framework's setup script.

### 4. Add Domain Knowledge

Create domain skills with references:

```bash
# In your project, after setup:
mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-domain/references/

# Use the add-reference skill to scan your codebase
/add-reference my-domain objects        # Scan and document your data model
/add-reference my-domain api-endpoints  # Document your API surface
```

### 5. Start Using

| `/quick-test` | Run tests on changed files only |
| `/lint-fix` | Auto-fix lint issues in changed files |
| `/check-types` | Run type checker |
| `/branch-status` | Show diff stats, PR status, CI checks |
| `/changelog` | Generate changelog from commits since last tag |
| `/dep-check` | Check for outdated or vulnerable dependencies |

### Rules (automatic guardrails)

File-pattern-scoped rules that Claude follows automatically when editing matching files:

| Rule | Applies To | Key Standards |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| `api-routes` | API handlers | Input validation, auth checks, structured errors, no PII in logs |
| `components` | UI components | Accessibility, error boundaries, <200 lines, loading/error states |
| `tests` | Test files | Use factories, descriptive names, no sleep waits, cleanup |
| `database` | Models, migrations | Parameterized queries, indexes, reversible migrations |
| `config-files` | JSON, YAML, TOML | No secrets, document values, validate at startup |
| `error-handling` | Source files | No silent catches, error tracking, context on re-throw |
| `auth-security` | Source files | Fail-closed auth, CSRF, RBAC enforcement, session security, redirects |
| `data-protection` | Source files | No PII in git, no credentials on disk, log redaction, third-party data |
| `design-system` | UI components | Semantic tokens, spacing scale, consistent typography, theme compliance |

### Hooks (lifecycle quality gates)

| Hook | When | What |
|------|------|------|
| `guardrails.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Blocks dangerous ops: deploys, migrations, force push, destructive deletes |
| `post-edit-sync.sh` | PostToolUse (Edit/Write) | Flags which docs need updating when files change |
| `session-start.sh` | SessionStart | Stale branch warning, env check, dependency health |
| `session-stop.sh` | SessionEnd | Audio notification (macOS, Linux, Windows) |
| `post-coding-review.sh` | SessionEnd | Nudges `/team review` when substantial source changes exist on branch |
| `pre-commit.sh` | Git pre-commit (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`) | Type check, lint, secret scan (AWS keys / private keys / hardcoded passwords), large-file guard |

### Skill Chaining (Factory Pipeline)

```
/draft-story (architect resolves questions)
    → Ticket "Ready for Sprint"
    ↓
/factory TICKET-xxx
    ↓
┌──────────────────────┐
│  READINESS GATE      │ → FAIL: return to architect with gap report
│  /check-readiness    │ → PASS: continue
└──────────┬───────────┘
           ↓
┌──────────────────────┐
│  IMPLEMENT           │ /develop (phases 1-5)
│  + VALIDATE          │ /validate (code standards)
└──────────┬───────────┘
           ↓
┌──────────────────────┐
│  COMMIT & PR         │ Push + create PR (triggers CI)
└──────────┬───────────┘
           ↓ (CI/CD)
┌──────────────────────┐
│  DEPLOY TO TEST ENV  │ CI workflow deploys, posts link
└──────────┬───────────┘
           ↓
┌──────────────────────┐
│  HUMAN REVIEW        │ Reviewer tests in deployed env
└──────────┬───────────┘
           ↓
┌──────────────────────┐
│  MERGE & DEPLOY      │ Auto-merge → deploy to staging/prod
└──────────┬───────────┘
           ↓ (background)
┌──────────────────────┐
│  FRAMEWORK IMPROVE   │ framework-improver auto-evolves .claude/ config
└──────────────────────┘
```

> The `framework-improver` agent runs automatically in the background after **any session where files were modified** — not just `/develop` and `/factory`. This is enforced via CLAUDE.md instructions, so documentation and `.claude/` config always stay in sync with the actual project state. Changes are logged to `docs/ai-improvements.md`.

## Self-Improvement System

The framework has a closed loop that keeps it honest over time. It's not one thing — it's five mechanisms working together:

| Layer | Component | When | What it does |
|-------|-----------|------|--------------|
| Advisory | `post-edit-sync.sh` (hook) | After every Edit/Write | Prints which doc surfaces may need updating based on what changed (e.g. "Agent 'code-reviewer' changed → verify README agents table") |
| Advisory | `post-coding-review.sh` (hook) | SessionEnd, when >=3 source files or >=50 LOC changed vs base | Nudges `/team review` (code-reviewer + security-auditor + ui-ux-reviewer); cooldown per branch+SHA prevents repeat nudges |
| Mutating | `framework-improver` (agent) | End of any session with changes — instructed by CLAUDE.md | Updates CLAUDE.md, `.claude/rules/`, settings, agents from project state; fills deferred placeholders (`{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}` etc.) |
| Verifying | `framework-qa` (agent, framework-repo-only) | End of any session with changes | Validates counts and tables across README, CLAUDE.md, docs are consistent with actual file inventory |
| Deterministic | `tests/run-all.sh` (5 test suites) | CI + before PR | Hard gates for drift: `check-consistency` (counts), `check-agent-registry` (agent JSON ↔ frontmatter ↔ docs, 72 checks), `check-placeholders` (sh/ps1 parity), `check-guardrails` (55 hook patterns), `check-templates` (structural validity) |

The advisory layers surface drift as it happens; the mutating layer fixes it; the verifying + deterministic layers prove it landed. Together they make it hard for documentation to drift from the actual state of the framework or your project.

See `docs/contributing.md` for how to extend each layer when adding new skills, agents, rules, or hooks.

## Integration Configuration

The framework connects to external systems through the **setup wizard** and **environment variables** -- not separate adapter files. During setup, you select your tracker, CI/CD platform, deployment target, and notification system. The wizard writes concrete API calls and commands into your skill files by replacing placeholder tokens (`{{TRACKER_*}}`, `{{CI_*}}`, `{{DEPLOY_*}}`, `{{NOTIFY_*}}`).

### Setup Wizard Integrations

| Category | Options | What Gets Configured |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| **Work Item Tracker** | Azure DevOps, Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues | Ticket fetch commands, field mappings, state transitions |
| **CI/CD Platform** | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI | Workflow files in `.github/workflows/` or equivalent |
| **Deployment Target** | Salesforce, AWS, Vercel, Docker/K8s, Generic | Deploy commands in `/deploy` skill and CI workflows |
| **Notifications** | Slack, Teams, Discord, None | Post-deploy and review notification commands |

### Credentials via .env

After setup, store API credentials in your project's `.env` file (never committed to git):

| Tracker | Required Variables |
|---------|--------------------|
| Azure DevOps | `AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT`, org/project in skill files |
| Jira | `JIRA_API_TOKEN`, `JIRA_EMAIL`, domain in skill files |
| Linear | `LINEAR_API_KEY` |
| GitHub Issues | Uses `gh` CLI (already authenticated) |

## Permissions (Safe-by-Default)

Setup installs `~/.claude/settings.json` with granular Bash permissions:

| Category | Behavior | Examples |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Auto-allowed** | Runs without asking | `git commit`, `npm test`, `cat`, `find`, `curl`, `sf apex run test`, `pytest` |
| **Must ask** | Prompts for confirmation | `git push`, `rm`, `sf project deploy`, `kubectl apply`, DB migrations |
| **Blocked** | Denied entirely | `rm -rf /`, `rm -rf ~`, `mkfs`, `dd if=` |

All non-Bash tools are auto-allowed: file editing, agents, tasks, teams, web access, worktrees, cron, plan mode. The framework-improver can freely update `.claude/` and `CLAUDE.md` without prompting.

## MCP Servers

The framework generates a `.mcp.json` at project root with pre-configured MCP servers:

| Server | Package | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Context7** | `@upstash/context7-mcp` | Fetches up-to-date, version-specific documentation for 9,000+ libraries. Works across all project types (Node.js, Python, Go, Java, Rails, etc.) |

Context7 tools (`resolve-library-id`, `get-library-docs`) are auto-allowed in the project permissions. Several skills and agents use Context7 proactively — they fetch current library docs before making implementation decisions, without requiring you to ask:

| Component | When It Uses Context7 |
|-----------|----------------------|
| `/develop` | Before implementing — fetches docs for project dependencies |
| `/draft-story` | When solution involves external dependencies — verifies API capabilities |
| `/refine-story` | During gap analysis — checks library APIs match ticket assumptions |
| `/mock-endpoint` | When mocking SDK endpoints — fetches real signatures and response shapes |
| `architect` | When reviewing integrations — verifies patterns match library recommendations |
| `api-designer` | When reviewing API frameworks/validators — checks current best practices |
| `documentation-writer` | When documenting library wrappers — ensures docs match actual API |
| `performance-optimizer` | When analyzing framework performance — fetches current optimization APIs |
| `test-writer` | When generating tests — fetches current test framework API patterns |

You can also trigger Context7 manually by adding "use context7" to any prompt when asking about specific libraries.

## Memory System

The framework sets up Claude Code's persistent memory:

```
~/.claude/projects/{project-path}/memory/
├── MEMORY.md          # Index (auto-loaded each conversation)
├── user_role.md       # Who you are, preferences
├── feedback_*.md      # Corrections and guidance
├── project_*.md       # Ongoing work context
└── reference_*.md     # External system pointers
```

## Customization

### Adding a Domain Skill

```bash
cp -r .claude/skills/_template .claude/skills/my-domain
# Edit .claude/skills/my-domain/SKILL.md
# Add references: .claude/skills/my-domain/references/*.md
```

### Adding Validation Rules

Edit `.claude/skills/validate/SKILL.md` to add project-specific checks to the check matrix.

### Changing the Pipeline

Edit `.claude/skills/factory/SKILL.md` to add/remove pipeline stages.
